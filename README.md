# DSGA-1001 Capstone Project: Fall 2021 @ NYU

The Kaggle dataset for the ML portion (for which I was responsible) can be found __[here](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)__ or through the Kaggle API with `kaggle datasets download -d jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package`

Note: The data herein has been adapted from that found in Australian Government's Bureau of Metereology __[page](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/)__.
___
The authors wanted answers to the following:

1)	Describe your overarching interest in this dataset. What are some meaningful meaningful plots and other visuals (e.g. Heatmap of the geographic location of precipitation or Min/Max temp) to illustrate temperature trends over time in Australia?
 
2)	Hypothesis testing: Have temperatures significantly changed over the time frame we are analyzing? Is it a sign of the presence of global warming? Design a test statistic to address the difference of temperatures.

3)	Linear Regression: What is the relationship between temperature and C02 emissions? What if we account for pressure and humidity? Investigate the relationship between the two variables.

4)	### Machine Learning: Can we effectively predict rain tomorrow using the data we have? How impactful are the features we regarded important in the previous parts? How far are the modelâ€™s performances from the state-of-the-art? Choose to implement one model between: XGBoost, CNN or some ensemble methods.

5)	Conclusions and Summary: Summarize the findings and state the main takeaways
